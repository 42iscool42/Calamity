# Calamity: Definitive Edition

This repo is housing the Minecraft Java profile for Calamity. Downloading it and creating a custom profile in your Minecraft Launcher which points to this folder will indeed let you view the most current version of what I have.

If you spot things which can be improved, go ahead and either make a pull request, or file an issue.

Keep in mind, this is still in very early development.

Very. Early. Not even the resource points are done.
